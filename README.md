#Comparision of prices between amazon and flipkart products <br>


> Firstly I've imported the datasets and did some data analysis to remove null values from both the sets<br>
> Then I've done some data visualization between different features of each sets<br>
>After some plots, I've dropped all the columns from both the tables except for product name, retail price and discount price because we only need those ones<br>
>Now both the dataframes are left with two columns each - discount price, retail price and name<br>

>The task is to display the prices in both amazon and flipkart for a particular product.<br>
>So I've merged both tables using joint.merge and then to display the product price which the user asks, I did it in 2 ways:<br>


*   ONE: I took user input of the product name and displayed it 
*   TWO: I made forms where on entering the name of product we get the table


> Then at last I've displayed the least price for a particular product for both websites
